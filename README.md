## Project Title
**Mental Mathematics of a Student**

---

## Project Description
This project aims to build strong fundamentals in mathematics for students by leveraging blockchain technology. The smart contract allows students to track their progress in mental mathematics, including their current level and score. The data is stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

---

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized platform where students can improve their mental mathematics skills in a gamified and secure environment. By using blockchain, we ensure that students' progress is tamper-proof and can be verified by educators or parents.

---

## Future Scope
1. **Gamification**: Introduce rewards and badges for achieving milestones.
2. **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow students to compete with peers in real-time mathematics challenges.
3. **Integration with Learning Platforms**: Connect the smart contract with educational platforms for seamless progress tracking.
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Provide insights into students' strengths and weaknesses based on their progress data.
5. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Expand the project to multiple blockchain networks for wider accessibility.

## Key Features
1. **Progress Tracking**: Students can update and retrieve their mathematics progress, including their level and score.
2. **Transparency**: All progress updates are stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.
3. **Event Logging**: Every progress update is logged as an event for easy tracking and verification.
4. **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive functions for updating and retrieving progress.
5. **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the data, making it secure and tamper-proof.
